# Layan Cursors for Windows

This is a windows cursor theme based on [Layan-Cursors](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Layan-cursors).

I used [win2xcur](https://pypi.org/project/win2xcur/) to convert the cursors to the cur/ani format that Windows uses.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/DJHero2903/Layan-cursors-Windows/releases/latest) the latest `Layan-Cursors-Windows.zip` release.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Open the folder of the cursor theme that you want to install.
1. Right click the `Install.inf` file and click the install option.
1. Open control panel and navigate to `Hardware and Sound > Mouse`.
1. Click on `Pointers` tab on the new window that opens.
1. Under the `Scheme` drop down menu, select the pointer theme that you wish to use.
1. Click apply, if you see a message box that says the cursor scheme already exists click `yes`.
1. Click ok.

Your cursor theme is now installed and enabled.
